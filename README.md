------ About ------

This is a custom user module I created to send commands to a Control4 Processor from a QSYS system using HTTP GET Commands.

This is Rev1 of this module. In the future i will be adding feedback and additional features.

MAKE SURE TO LEAVE CREDIT INSIDE THE CODE.

THIS IS NOT FOR RESALE.

------ Req. ------

Control4 Driver from : https://untestedhacks.com/2013/web-events-driver/

Direct Download Link: http://untestedhacks.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/webevents.zip

Install Driver on Control4 Proccessor and then program commands. 

Once commands have been set up in Control4 you can jump into the Qsys module and follow the internal documentation.
